Concept document for Mycelvania  
Inspiration from this [Tumblr post](https://www.tumblr.com/thatluckybear/760916363336384512/suddenly-i-want-to-make-an-entire-metroidvania?source=share)  

## Outline
A mushroom piloting a mech suit finds its way through a mazelike world to reconnect to it's mycelial network  
Game follows fairly standard metroidvania format with vehicle powerups like Blaster Master

## Progression + Stages ideas
I think 4 or 5 powerups would be ideal to keep the length reasonable each powerup should be related to the needs of a particular area 
- Forest Outside Laboratory - zipline
  - Exiting the lab you end up in a forest and getting across the gap to the next area requires zipline powerup
- Lake
  - You fall into the water and can't go up navigating to the powerup then getting to swim upwards to the exit
- Sewers
  - beneath the city there are walls that you can't get past without the charge ability
- Mountain City
  - Get to the top of the mountain with double jump
- Revisit the Sewers to find new area with double jump to get wall crawl
- Revisit Forest to reaccess the lab (final area) with new abilities
  - Beat the area and complete the game
