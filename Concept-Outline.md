Concept document for Mycelvania  
Inspiration from this [Tumblr post](https://www.tumblr.com/thatluckybear/760916363336384512/suddenly-i-want-to-make-an-entire-metroidvania?source=share)  

## Outline
A mushroom piloting a mech suit finds its way through a mazelike world to reconnect to it's mycelial network  
Game follows fairly standard metroidvania format with vehicle powerups like Blaster Master

## Progression + Stages ideas
Tank begins with a blaster and 10 health that can be optionally powered up. To progress the player must find the area boss and defeat it netting a new power up that allows progress to the next area.
- Forest Outside Laboratory - zipline
  - Exiting the lab you end up in a forest and getting across the gap to the next area requires zipline powerup
- Lake
  - You fall into the water and can't go up navigating to the powerup then getting to swim upwards to the exit
- Sewers
  - beneath the city there are walls that you can't get past without the charge ability
- Mountain City
  - Get to the top of the mountain with double jump
- Revisit the Sewers to find new area with double jump to get wall crawl
- Revisit Forest to reaccess the lab (final area) with new abilities
  - Beat the area and complete the game
 
## Bonus powerups
Health upgrades  
Power Upgrades
Cosmetic upgrades  
#### bonus considerations
I like the powerup/soul gathering from Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow and also the weapon systems so I'd like to consider this.
Cave story has the "float gun" which was really cool and fun should/can I do something similar?

## Shortcuts
Exploration is rewarded with bonuses lore, and easter eggs.   
To reduce tedium shortcut/fast travel becomes available after stage 3 (lake) is completed

## Map
[Map Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JpOJWPKX2DJZIuJuFJCngbJOFRgO24jViC-eYjxTDHQ/edit?usp=sharing)
Map should circle back on itself from later areas to allow more exploration of areas once new unlocks are available
